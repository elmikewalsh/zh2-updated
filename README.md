ZH2 WP Theme - An Updated Remake of the Zenhabits Website

<strong>Languages:</strong> English, Espa√±ol

<p>The <a href="http://zenhabits.net/theme/" target="_blank">original version</a> of this theme was created by <a href="http://leobabauta.com" target="_blank">Leo Babauta</a> and is the theme currently used by the very popular website <a href="http://zenhabits.net" target="_blank">zenhabits</a>. This is an updated version.</p>

<p>This revised version of the zh2 Theme keeps the same design elements as the original, including fonts, menus, layout, etc. It&rsquo;s main purpose is to make the process of setting up your blog quicker and more painless, while staying true to the minimalist philosophy.</p>

<p>In addition, the search feature on the Archives page is configured to automatically search for results on your site using Google search. No editing of code required!</p><p>I might also mention that, despite all these additions, the theme size is much smaller. (the original zh2 was 128kb &ndash; mainly due to the unnecessarily large screenshot size.) The new theme archive size <strong>is just 28kb</strong>!</p>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is an old WordPress theme. I neither promise nor provide any support.
